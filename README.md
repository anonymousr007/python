> 1. Yes,I build a community of coders,developers and hackers like hackathon participants and mentors too.
My organization name is bitandbytes8 [https://github.com/bitandbytes8] and it's open source.
Working of my organization teach coding and development such as web development,machine learning, deep learning, quantum computing, quantum machine learning, competitive coding, core subjects such as data structure and algorithms, database and management system, operating system, theory of computation, compiler design, object oriented programming, languages such as c++, python, java, javascript and much more etc, actually my plans are realistic if github support me so it's reality by me, and also develop large scale real projects solve real problem. 
2. Struggle faced by students proper awareness regarding programs, mentorship,what can they do or what cannot? that's the real struggle faced by students, a lot technologies in which one more scope in future market and all these problems struggles.

3. Our community get support by github to organised hackathons, challenges and workshops 

4. I had 5 years teaching experience so i want to become a teacher to taught computer science core subjects and famous technologies.
